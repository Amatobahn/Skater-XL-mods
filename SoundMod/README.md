# SXL-SoundMod

This mod changes the game sounds and removes the intro music.
Download it in [releases](https://github.com/andreamatt/SXL-SoundMod/releases) and install it using [UMM](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager)

Sounds go in the SXL/Mods/SoundMod/Sounds folder.
They must follow this pattern. They must be in **.wav** format.
The asterisk means "anything", so:
bumps*.wav => bumps1.wav, bumps_01.wav, bumps_best_bump_ever.wav

The releases include Jboogie's sounds as default.

**Not all sounds are used by the game.**
